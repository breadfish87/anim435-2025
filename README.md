# anim435-2025

usage: To create a new maya scene and create a random amount of spheres, ranging from 5-20, and then randomly scatter them within 10 units of the orgin


This script could be used if obejcts need to be randomly scatter across a scene without having to access the scene itself, the object doesn't have to be limited to just spheres and could easily be replaced with more complex obejcts if required

Steps:

Open gitbash and enter:  mayapy assignment3.py . This will create a new maya scene with the name: "rpy26-ANIM435-2025-assignment04-HW_file.ma" in the same directory as the python script. If a maya workspace does not exist the script will create one.
